            controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events,
            arising out of or relating to the DEGEN SANTAS, DEGEN ELVES, and
            DEGEN REINDEER NFTs, this Agreement and prior versions thereof
            (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
            validity thereof), payments made by you or any payments made or
            allegedly owed to you, any promotions or offers made by Company, any
            city, county, state or federal trade secrets, unfair competition,
            discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation,
            emotional distress, breach of any express or implied contract or
            covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection
            laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the
            Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and
            claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act
            of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, and state statutes, if
            any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other
            federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes
            concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes about
            the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity
            of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator,
            except as expressly provided below.
            <br />
            <br />
            BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE
            WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL
            CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION
            AGREEMENT. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require
            arbitration of every claim or dispute that can lawfully be
            arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms
            of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the
            requirement to arbitrate.
            <br />
            <br />
            (b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
            <br />
            <br />
            YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS
            IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND
            NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (“CLASS
            ACTION WAIVER”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY BOTH
            ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A
            PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR
            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS
            SUBSECTION (B) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS
            GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST COMPANY, WHICH ARE ADDRESSED
            SEPARATELY IN other SECTIONs.
            <br />
            <br />
            The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any
            Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual
            basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve
            any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or
            representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
            injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
            relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
            by that party’s individual claims.
            <br />
            <br />
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
            Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the
            scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of
            the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of
            competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in
            which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or
            representative action and (2) there is a final judicial
            determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with
            respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a
            request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular
            remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed
            from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a
            civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver
            shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all
            other Claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            (c) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
            <br />
            <br />
            Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement
            shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association
            (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in
            effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the
            terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of these rules can be
            obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA Rules”) or by
            calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
            requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances
            of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to
            select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the
            arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise
            preside over any form of a representative, collective, or class
            proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration
            administrator upon mutual written agreement.
            <br />
            <br />
            As part of the arbitration, both you and Company will have the
            opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information
            that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator may award any
            individualized remedies that would be available in court. The
            arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
            of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
            necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
            claims.
            <br />
            <br />
            The case shall be heard by one arbitrator, who shall be an executive
            with a company in the entertainment event production industry. The
            arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance
            with applicable law and will honor all claims of privilege
            recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in
            prior arbitrations involving different Users but is bound by rulings
            in prior arbitrations involving the same User to the extent required
            by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding
            and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
            in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
            <br />
            <br />
            (d) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
            <br /> <br />
            The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the
            relevant AAA Rules subject to the following modification: The
            arbitrator in his award shall allocate all arbitration fees in his
            sole discretion and shall have the power to charge reasonable
            attorney fees of the successful party to the losing party.
            <br />
            <br />
            (e) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unless you and Company agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
            between Company and a User will take place in the county of your
            billing address. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county,
            the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
            location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be
            determined by the AAA Rules.
            <br />
            <br />
            (f) Exceptions to Arbitration.
            <br />
            <br />
            This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the
            following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an
            individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims
            court’s jurisdiction. Where these claims are brought in a court of
            competent jurisdiction, Company will not require arbitration of
            those claims. Company agreement not to require arbitration of these
            claims does not waive the enforceability of any other provision of
            this Arbitration Agreement, or of the enforceability of this
            Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or
            controversy.
            <br />
            <br />
            Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or
            excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
            agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust
            administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration
            However, should you bring an administrative claim, you may only seek
            or recover money damages of any type pursuant to this Arbitration
            Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek
            or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative
            complaint. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement
            prevents your participation in an investigation by a government
            agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this
            Arbitration Provision.
            <br />
            <br />
            (g) Severability.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and
            (c) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration
            Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law
            not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed, and the
            remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and
            effect.
            <br />
            <br />
            (h) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Company may
            agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim, or
            controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless this
            time period is mutually extended by you and Company. A party who
            intends to seek negotiation under this subsection must first send to
            the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The Notice
            must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and
            (2) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises,
            conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course
            of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees,
            and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any
            purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in
            arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties.
