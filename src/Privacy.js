          <h2>Collection of Your Personal and Other Information</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            When you register on this website, we collect Personal Information.
            By “Personal Information” we mean information that can identify an
            individual, such as:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Your Internet Protocol (IP address)</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            You may choose not to provide Personal Information, but this may
            prevent you from receiving updates from this website.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may also collect non-Personal Information relating to this
            website, that is, information that does not personally identify an
            individual. The non-Personal Information we may collect includes how
            you interact with this website, information generally collected or
            “logged” by Internet websites or Internet services when accessed or
            used by users, and information about your web browser or device
            accessing or using this website.
            <br />
            <br />
            Examples of the non-Personal Information we may collect are:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Information about your computer or mobile device, such as its
              maker or operating system version, and HTTP header information
            </li>
            <li>The pages of our website that you viewed during a visit;</li>
            <li>
              What information, or content you view or interact with using this
              website; and
            </li>
            <li>
              The city, state, province, and country in which you are located;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            We will not use non-Personal Information to try to identify you, and
            if we associate any non-Personal Information with information that
            personally identifies you, then we will treat it as Personal
            Information. As discussed in more detail below, we sometimes use
            cookies and other automatic information gathering technologies to
            gather non-Personal Information.
            <br />
            <br />
            Information collected by this website may be collected by us or one
            of our service providers, but in either case, this Privacy Policy
            will govern the collection, use, and sharing of the information.

          <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties as
            described below.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may disclose Personal Information to provide services to you, or
            when you authorize or instruct us to do so.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may disclose Personal Information and non-Personal Information to
            those companies, agents, contractors, service providers, or others
            engaged to perform functions on our behalf (such as the provision of
            data storage, hosting of our website, conducting audits, and
            performing web analytics).
            <br />
            <br />
            We may license third-party software to include in or use with this
            website, in which case we may disclose Personal Information and/or
            Non-Personal Information to the licensor. These third parties’
            collection and use of Personal Information and non-Personal
            Information are subject to their own privacy policies.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may also disclose Personal Information to other third parties
            upon your consent to such disclosures.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information to third
            parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion,
            that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce or apply
            the terms and conditions of this website, including investigation of
            potential violations thereof, (b) comply with legal or regulatory
            requirements or an enforceable governmental request, (c) protect the
            rights, property or safety of this website, our users or other third
            parties, (d) prevent a crime or protect national security, or (e)
            detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
            issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, we reserve the right to transfer information (including
            your Personal Information) to a third party in the event of a sale,
            merger, or transfer of all or a portion of the assets of our company
            relating to this website, or in the event of a bankruptcy,
            liquidation, or receivership of our business. We will use
            commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of such transfer, for
            example via email or by posting a notice on our website.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lastly, we may also disclose non-Personal Information, aggregated
            with information about our other users, to our business partners,
            merchants, investors, potential buyers, and other third parties if
            we deem such disclosure, in our sole discretion, to have sound
            business reasons or justifications.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Cookies and Automatic Information Gathering Technologies</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Every time you use this website we collect non-Personal Information
            (discussed above in Section 2) regarding that use. For example, to
            improve this website, we collect how, when, and which parts of this
            website or its features you use, which third-party platforms you
            connect to this website. Also, we may use your device’s unique
            identifier (UDID), media access control address (MAC Address), or
            other unique identifiers to assist us in collecting and analyzing
            this data.
            <br />
            <br />
            To assist us in collecting and storing this non-Personal
            Information, we may employ a variety of technologies, including
            “Cookies,” local browser storage, and “Web Beacons.” A “Cookie” is a
            small amount of data a website operator or a third party whose
            content is embedded in that website, may store in your web browser,
            and that the website operator or, as applicable, the third party,
            can access when you visit the website. A Cookie may also refer to
            web-browser-based storage provided by Adobe’s Flash plugin (a “Flash
            Cookie”). Cookies may contain user preferences, unique identifiers,
            and other non-Personal Information. A “Web Beacon” is a small,
            usually transparent image placed on a web page that allows the
            operator of that image, which may be the operator of the website you
            visit or a third party, to read or write a Cookie.
            <br />
            <br />
            We and/or vendors may use Cookies to track the movements of
            individual users through this website and elsewhere on the web or
            across apps, devices, and geographic locations, to help diagnose
            problems with servers, to gather broad demographic information, to
            conduct research, to record registration and/or personalization
            information, and to otherwise administer this website.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, we may use Cookies in our communications with you, such
            as within e-mail to determine which messages have been opened by
            recipients.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your operating system and web browser may allow you to erase the
            information stored in Cookies, Flash Cookies, and local browser
            storage. But if you do so, you may be forced to log in to this
            website again (if applicable) and you may lose some preferences or
            settings. You may also be able to set your browser to refuse all
            website storage or to indicate when it is permitted, but some
            features of this website may not function properly without it. We
            may use Cookies to keep you logged in, save your preferences for
            this website, and collect information about how you use this
            website.

          <h2>Transparency and Choice</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            You may request access to your Personal Information by sending an
            email to hello@degensantas.io. We will try to locate and provide you
            with your Personal Information and give you the opportunity to
            correct this data, if it is inaccurate, or to delete it, at your
            request. But, in either case, we may need to retain it for legal
            reasons or for legitimate business purposes.
            <br />
            <br />
            We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information
            requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing
            such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are
            unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
            technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be
            extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
            residing on backups), or relate to information that is not
            associated with your Personal Information. In any case, where we
            provide information access and correction, we perform this service
            free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
            effort.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please be aware that if you request us to delete your Personal
            Information, you may not be able to continue to use this website.
            Also, even if you request that we delete your Personal Information,
            we may need to retain certain information for a limited period of
            time to satisfy our legal, audit, and/or dispute resolution
            requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can opt-out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by clicking
            on the “unsubscribe” link in the e-mails. Please note that it may
            take up to ten (10) business days for your opt-out request to be
            processed. Also, even if you opt-out of marketing e-mails, we may
            continue to send you certain account-related e-mails, such as
            notices about your account and confirmations of transactions you
            have requested.

            (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes
            and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we
            shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
            year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a
            request, please submit your request in writing to us using the
